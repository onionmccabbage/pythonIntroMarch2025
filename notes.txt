Monday
- Welcome and intros
- where to write code: module (just a file) or immediate python
- architecture, structure, and professional code best practice
- print() and input()
- maths operators and data types
- indentation
- immutable strings
- print formatting
- lists and tuples (and memory efficiency)
- identifiers
- boolean True and False
- type and type conversion
- the if statement for conditional logic
- for, while, break and pass
- validate inpu
- after lunch review exercise
- dictionaries (non-numeric indexed iterable collections)
- import, libraries and modules
  to see what libraries are already installed: pip list
- functions

Tuesday
- how to access course recordings
- quick review of where we got to
- Python 2 awareness...
  see https://python.land/migrating-from-python-2-to-3/how-to-migrate-to-python-3
- if __name__ == '__main__'
- range, generators
- comprehensions
- to add libraries to python:
  - python -m ensurepip
  - python â€“m pip install requests (or any other library you need)
- using requests (to access web API via HTTP)
  (NB be careful - may not work within WSL)
- strings with triple quotes
- exception handling (try-except etc.)
- debug tools   
- review exercise
- File input and output

Wednesday
- in Python EVERTHING is an Object - every function, every class every module....
- any input or output is necessarily slow: I/O bound
- anything with __nnn__ is part of python (built in features) called 'dunder'
- functions live in classes, which live in modules which live in packages
- PEP8 style guide https://pep8.org/
- custom generator and yield
- global and local scope 
- data modelling structures: 
    use built in structures until they do not suit the purpose (then use classes)
- Objects and Classes (OOP)
  classes have properties (something belonging to the class) and methods (something the class can do)
- get/set as property decorators @property
- name mangling (__) and __slots__
- properties, methods, __str__
- inheritance
- review exercise
- venv see https://python.land/virtual-environments/virtualenv
- end of course feedback:
